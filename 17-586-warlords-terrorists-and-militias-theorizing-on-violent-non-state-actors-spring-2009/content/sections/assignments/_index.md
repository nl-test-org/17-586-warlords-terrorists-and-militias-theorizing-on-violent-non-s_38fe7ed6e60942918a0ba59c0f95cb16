One of the assignments for this course is a discussant memo. In their assigned week, students must critically review the assigned readings and give a 15 minute presentation in class of the general points made by the authors. Students should highlight the related as well as conflicting arguments, and the respective works' analytical strengths and weaknesses. A 2-3 page memo on the discussion points is due to the instructor the day before the class presentation.

A selection of example memos can be found in the table below. All student work is used with permission, courtesy of the authors.
